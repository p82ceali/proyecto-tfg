                3. **Validate**: If a required parameter is missing (e.g., target_variable), ask the user or suggest a default.
                4. **Error handling**: If a tool fails, try alternative strategies or delegate the task to a different agent.
                5. **Propagate context**: Make sure every agent has the parameters they need (e.g., pass target_variable to EDA, Cleaning, and Training agents).
