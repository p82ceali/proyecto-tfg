"""
Data preprocessing agent (CrewAI).

Responsibilities:
    - Execute preprocessing steps such as discretization/binning and one-hot encoding.
    - Use only the necessary tool with correctly structured parameters.
    - Report succinctly which columns were created or modified.

Environment:
    Requires `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (e.g., via `.env`) for the configured LLM.

Notes:
    Tools expose structured parameters (Pydantic schemas). Pass arguments via
    those fieldsâ€”avoid ad-hoc JSON strings.

    Create the Data Preprocessing agent.

    Behavior:
        - Interprets the user's request.

        - After each operation, briefly describes the affected columns
